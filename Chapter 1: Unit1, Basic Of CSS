<!--Explanation: 
1. The <style> tag is placed after the <title> tag to include CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) 
in the HTML document without the <style> tag, CSS code can't be added directly in the HTML File
2.The <div> tag is opened inside the <body> tag to group and structure content.
3.The CSS rule p { color : green; } means that all <p> (paragraph) elements will 
have green text. You can also replace "green" with any other color you prefer.
4) And that's it much love :d
