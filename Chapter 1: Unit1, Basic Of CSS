<!--Explanation: 
you need to open style tag after title
You need to open style tag because without style tag we can't 
write CSS Code 
and you need to open div tag after the body if you couldn't open it
doesn't work then p{ 
color: green
} means that paragraph text will be green or you can choose your favourite color too
