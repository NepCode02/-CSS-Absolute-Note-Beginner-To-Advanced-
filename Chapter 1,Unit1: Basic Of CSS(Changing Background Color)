<!--Explanation....
body is the selector, which targets the entire body of the webpage.
Inside the curly braces { }, the property and value pair is specified.
background-color is the property, which defines the background color of the selected element (in this case, the entire page).
aqua is the value assigned to the background-color property, meaning the background of the webpage will be set to an aqua color.-->
